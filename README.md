# ros_loadingscreen

This is a loading-identity script for ESX Framework. Ros_identity is based on esx_identity, so sql functions ar the same. The loading-screen for regular use is this video description: https://youtu.be/QvcMj6QS_7k . And the identity part is on this other: https://youtu.be/8U8f_QF0O4E . Both scripts have dependency each other as they do screen fadein and fadeouts on different parts.
